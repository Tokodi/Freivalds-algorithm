# Freivalds' Algorithm

A simple C++ implementation of Freivalds' Algorithm to determine if A * B = C -- where A,B and C are
matrices of the same dimension -- is true.

## Input

The program reads 'input.txt' file, which has to be written in the following format:

\<matrices dimension\> \<try count\>

\<A\>

\<B\>

\<C\>
